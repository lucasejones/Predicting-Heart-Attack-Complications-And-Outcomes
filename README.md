# Predicting Heart Attack Complications And Outcomes


Hello, and welcome! In this project, the goal is to accurately predict what will happen to someone who has been hospitalized from having a heart attack.

As noted in the dataset's description, the prediction of complications from myocardial infarction (heart attack) is both historically challenging and important. Specialists can struggle to accurately predict the development and severity of these complications, leading to worse health, or even death. If we could understand more about the relationships between past patients and the outcomes of their heart attacks, then in theory we could make medical decisions for new patients that anticipate, and hopefully avoid, future suffering.

The dataset we'll be working with was created by individuals from the Krasnoyarsk State Medical University in Russia, and University of Leicester in England.

It's worth noting that the patients in this dataset are not a representative sample of the global population, but a 1700-person-large sample from 1992-1995 from one location. If we had data about other demographics at other times, we may have a more generalized understanding of heart attack outcomes, but we can still continue with this distinction in mind.
